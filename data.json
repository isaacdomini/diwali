It was a lot more festive (in general) than what I had experienced in Columbus when I was growing up. I remember the fountain fireworks that me and my new brother-in-law had lined up, and we tried to light them all as fast as we could (it was an impromptu competition that neither of us won because we wimped out on the middle one). The other memory that I had was when I was in school in India. We had gotten so many different fireworks that we got to play around with and ate all the sweets that we could buy or got sent to us from our family.",

We write the day, date, all attendees including the names of our ancestors and ask the Universe for its blessings. We pray to the Lakshmi - Goddess of prosperity to let good prevail over evil and for Universe to light the way for us all. We light candles around the house, design a Rangoli on our front porch and of course set off fireworks.",
    "traditions": "We actually have two traditions handed down generations _ we have old coins (circa 1900s) that we hand wash and then put the symbol of Ganesha on the coins. This tradition for us signifies to wash away the past and look forward to a prosperous future. The other tradition is to have boiled, seasoned black chick peas. We come from a lineage of warriors and farmers, where that was the primary source of protein and nutrition. So we thank the earth for its bounty and giving us strength.",
    "diwali_meaning": "In one word - Enlightenment. On Diwali we count our blessings and pray for a brighter future. Diwali enforces that good will always prevail over evil and we all need to have an everlasting light inside us to light the path for us and others in times of darkness. Diwali also reminds us that doing the right thing, no matter how difficult, arduous or onerous is the only way to fight against injustices and help vanquish the darkness.",

We get to do some of the things here (i.e., make sweets, set off fireworks, see family, etc.) but we don't get to celebrate like they do there. I also love getting to listen to Gujarati music and doing Garba (a dance style originating from Gujarat, India) with my entire family.",
    "food": "My mom makes a lot of amazing sweets and savory snacks including Mohanthal (sweet), Ghughra (sweet), Topra Pak (sweet made out of coconut), Sev (savory snack made out of chickpea flour- picture attached), Chavanu (savory) and Fulwadi (savory snack found mostly in Gujarat) but my favorite sweet to eat are Peda (sweets made out of dairy, sugar, cardamom seeds, pistachio nuts and saffron.)",
    "celebrate": "I love going to visit my cousins and extended family during this holiday and welcoming in the new year with them. We dance, eat amazing food and listen to all of our parents tell us about how they were able to celebrate this holiday in India. Fun fact- people in our villages would color the horns of cows different colors because they're sacred to us and we believe they're celebrating this holiday with us.",
    "traditions": "For this holiday, we go to the temple to pray to, and thank, Goddess Lakshmi for all the money and protection she has given us so far this year and wish for good luck for the upcoming year. We also take a shower really early in the morning, wear new clothes, and take sweets to our family and friends to symbolize a prosperous and happy new year.",
    "diwali_meaning": "To me, Diwali means hope and happiness. Nothing makes me happier than being able to be around my family and friends and bringing hope and wellness to them. Diwali is a 5 day festival with each day signifying something different, but every day has morning rituals, tons of lights and fireworks on display.<br/>- The first day of Diwali is called \"Dhanteras\" and this is when we pray to Goddess Lakshmi and thank her for all the money and protection she has provided us over the year.<br/>- The second day of Diwali is called \"Kali Chaudas\" and this is the day we celebrate the win of good over evil and are able to shine light on our life.<br/>- The third day of Diwali is actually \"Diwali\" and this is where the \"festival of lights\" comes into play because so many households set out many candles to illuminate the streets. Family members come together to celebrate the end of the year with one another.<br/>- The fourth day of Diwali is the New Year and called \"Annakut\". I celebrate by going to my friends and family and wishing them a \"Sal Mubarak\" (aka Happy New Year). On this day, everyone wakes up super early, wear new clothes and then takes sweets to their friends/family members and celebrate with them. I love seeing everyone giving each other hugs and being so happy!<br/>- The last day of Diwali is called \"Bhai Beej\" and on this day, brothers go to their sister's homes for dinner. Brothers bring sweets and gifts for their sisters and the sisters cook for their brothers and wish them good luck for the upcoming year. This is another one of our holidays that celebrate the bond of siblings and I think it's just so amazing.",
